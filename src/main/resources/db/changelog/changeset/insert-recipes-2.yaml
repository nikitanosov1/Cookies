                  value: Lula kebab is a meat dish popular in the Middle East and Central Asia. It is difficult to accurately determine its homeland, all because it has many varieties. From the Persian language, kebab translates as "fried meat". And the method of cooking this fried meat is different for different peoples. Lula kebab is called minced meat or minced meat, strung on a skewer and fried on coals. A kind of meat cutlet, but without the addition of eggs, flour or bread. Minced meat is kneaded long enough to form a homogeneous dense mass. Due to this, the finished product does not disintegrate during heat treatment. Properly prepared lula kebab is toasted golden crust and juicy meat inside. Add to it a hot homemade tortilla, fresh vegetables, herbs and various sauces-it's impossible to resist! In my case, lula kebab is prepared at home in an electric oven. The aroma and taste qualities were not affected.

                  value: Pea soup with stew - A recipe for cooking in a slow cooker. Pea soups are probably one of the most satisfying (well, at least in my opinion). But if you also send stew there — it seems that it turns out to be generally wonderful. Moreover, a good stew still improves the taste of the soup very well. Additional advantages also include simple ingredients and a simple recipe. So ahead of us is waiting for Pea soup with stew.

                  value: Grind flour, salt and butter between your palms so that the mixture looks like bread crumbs. Then add the beaten egg and knead the dough. Roll into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30-50 minutes. Clean pumpkin, remove seeds. Cut the pulp into cubes. Put in a saucepan, add water and simmer until soft and the liquid has completely evaporated. Grind the pulp with a blender into a homogeneous mass. Roll out the dough. Put a sheet of baking paper on top of the dough and fill in any cereal. This will allow the cake to bake evenly. Bake for 15 minutes at 190 degrees. Put pumpkin puree in a deep bowl, beat with two eggs, sugar, cream, spices and salt. Pour the mixture into the baked dough. Bake the cake for 50-55 minutes at 180 degrees. When the cake has cooled, it can be safely cut into portions.
